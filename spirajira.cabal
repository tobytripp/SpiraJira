-- A longer description of the package.
description:
  Spirogyra is very common in relatively clean eutrophic water,
  developing slimy filamentous green masses. In spring Spirogyra grows
  under water, but when there is enough sunlight and warmth they
  produce large amounts of oxygen, adhering as bubbles between the
  tangled filaments. The filamentous masses come to the surface and
  become visible as slimy green mats.  (Wikipedia)
