* SpiraJira: Cut Through the Scum

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Spirogyra is very common in relatively clean eutrophic water,
  developing slimy filamentous green masses. In spring Spirogyra grows
  under water, but when there is enough sunlight and warmth they
  produce large amounts of oxygen, adhering as bubbles between the
  tangled filaments. The filamentous masses come to the surface and
  become visible as slimy green mats.  (Wikipedia)

  A crude command-line client for Jira.  If you have to use it, at
least you won't have to touch it.

* Commands

** Show an Issue

   Prints the Summary, Description, and Comments for the specified Ticket:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   spirajira TB-001
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
     TB-001 :: On the Many Problems Inherent in Mis-using Jira for Planning
     [In Development]

     This hurts.  Why do we keep doing this to ourselves?

     But I like doing it this way.  I never have to talk to anybody and
     it's nearly impossible for anyone to find out how terrible I am at
     my job.

* Installation

  Hold on.  Let's make sure it works first.

* Configuration

  SpiraJira reads login credentials and Server URI from a configuration file.

  By default, it will read files in this order:
    1. $(HOME)/.spirajira
    2. ./spirajira.cfg
    3. a file specified with the =--config= option

  The configuration file should look something like this:

  #+BEGIN_SRC conf
    user = "ticketdrone557"
    pass = "comply!"
    uri  = "https://jira.host/rest/api/2/"
  #+END_SRC
